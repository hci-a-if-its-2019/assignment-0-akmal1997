<h1>Assignment 0: Bad Design</h1>

<h2>What is this?</h2>
Yes, in this assignment, i want to analyze to any possible design flaw in some cases that you can found in somewhere

<h2>Examples of possible of bad designed products:</h2>

<h3>1. Automatic doors on Indonesian Executive Class train</h3>

<b>Description:</b>
<br>
On many older Executive Class train (especially made in year 1995-2010), they had an automatic doors feature. So, you can only push the button to open the doors

<b>Problems:</b>
<br>
Nowdays, because that features was omitted on newer train and many older train after final maintenance (or Perawatan Akhir or abbreviated as PA if PT KAI says) on train workshop (or Balai Yasa) start from 2016, some people don't know if the door is automatically operated using the button on left/right side and just slide the door with the handle (and the handle on that door is used only for emergency if the electricity was gone and the automatic mechanism was cut, so you can slide the door easily) and heavy (because of the automatic mechanism). So, the door can easily broken and the automatic mechanism cannot be operated again
<br>
<br>
After that, many train depot don't place a notice about automatic door and many of them sticked with "GESER" (or SLIDE) word on top of handle (But the door can operated with buttons on left side)
<br>
<br>
The example just like in below. This picture and video was taken from Lodaya Train (from Bandung to Yogyakarta and Solo) and on 2009 made executive class coaches (Click picture for video)

<b>Solutions:</b>
<br>
<br>
You must rid the handle and stick a notice on door. Just like this (The example pictures was on Argo Bromo Anggrek Train (from Jakarta to Surabaya) on a 1997 built train (train serial number: K1 0 97 12 SBI):

<br>
Or, if the handle cannot be omitted because of safety reasons, you can stick the notice in the door and the location of the button. Just like this:

<h3>2. PT KAI Public Information Display System Software (PIDS)</h3>

<b>Description:</b>
<br>
This software can founded on newer generation trains (2016-2019) on the operator room (inside dining car). This software for set the electronic LED board (Inside for GPS and outside for train name and coach number)

<b>Problems:</b>
<br>
Let's look for the software picture:
<br>
1. For the waypoint map, you must input manually for the waypoint. The waypoint not embedded with the GPS and Maps installed on GPS. And, there are cannot add the waypoint manually (All saved in one file, you must click "Buka File" (Open File) and that file contains the journey detail and waypoint
<br>
2. You cannot config the journey details manually (from the picture) (Because you must open the file first)
<br>
3. If the another train was placed and the train serial number doesn't exist on train configuration (Konfigurasi Kereta) dropdown, you cannot add it manually (Only from the picture, i don't know if can)
<br>
<br>
<b>Solutions:</b>
<br>
1. Add the features on software (like manually config journey details, manual configuration)
<br>
2. Embed a map to a GPS installed on PIDS system. So, it can used easily without configure a waypoints
